        <p><em>C#, Unity, PHP, MySQL</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Last Stand</strong> is my first project in Unity. The goal was to create a Bullet Hell game using only primitive shapes without using the Unity Inspector.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Last Stand</strong> is a rhythm-based bullet hell game where you must survive as long as possible against incoming projectiles. The game is played with the arrow keys, and the sole goal is survival. Defeating the boss after surviving long enough leads to a new boss appearance.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            Of all the six projects I had to do for school, <strong>Last Stand</strong> was by far the most enjoyable to create. It really forced me to be creative with shapes to make a fun and interesting game. 
            The goal was for every team member to create one of the four bosses, and I got to create the "final" boss, which had three phases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each phase was introduced by a new part of the song, introducing new mechanics and projectiles, while also reusing some of the old ones for familiarity. 
            I also learned about object pooling to ensure the game ran smoothly without lag, especially with many projectiles on the screen.
