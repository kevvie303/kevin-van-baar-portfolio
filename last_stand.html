    <h1>Last Stand</h1>
    <p>Game design and development</p>
    <p><em>C#, Unity, PHP, MySQL</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Last Stand is my first project in Unity. It required the team to create a Bullet Hell game using only primitive shapes and without using the Unity inspector.</p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    
    <h2>Process</h2>
    We had discussed early on my main focus would be on the game mechanics, the weapons, the art and the back-end, my partner would focus on enemies.  
    Something that was new for me was back-end, I had to learn this completely from scratch. I ended up using Google Firebase for this, post and retrieving data through only JavaScript.
    In the end, I learned a solid amount of new things for Javascript and back-end. I learned here to use classes for Javascript and to use multiple files to make the code easier to maintain.
