        <h1>A-Moebe</h1>
        <p class="project-type">Hardware Interfacing</p>
        <p class="tech-stack"><em>Python, HTML, SCSS, JS, Flask</em></p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            A-Moebe is an ongoing project that I've been developing with my girlfriend since June of 2023. 
            It's a gamerunner that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi to control the game flow of an escape room.
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            This system started development because a friend began his own escape room business and needed a system to automate many manual processes.
            My girlfriend and I created multiple MVPs to meet the necessary requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            I handled all of the back-end development using Python, Flask, and a lot of JavaScript, while she focused on the front-end, also teaching me in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, we used ongoing SSH connections to control the Raspberry Pi's outputs for lights and magnetic locks, but this was too slow for real-time data needs.
            We then switched to using WebSockets/MQTT for faster and more reliable communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            The system is still in development, future plans include cleaning up the code massively and seperating all the different parts into their own files. 
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>A-Moebe includes several features to control different aspects of the escape room:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Reset List:</strong> Ensures no mistakes during resetting, as the game can only start when all steps are completed.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Task List:</strong> Shows the host where players are in the game and allows solving tasks if no sensors are in place, triggering consequences like lights or locks.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Actuator Control:</strong> Allows forced control of outputs during or outside of a game.

            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Status Monitoring:</strong> Real-time updates on lights, locks, sensor triggers, keypad entries, and more, all displayed for the host.
