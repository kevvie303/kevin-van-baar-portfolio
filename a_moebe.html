    <h1>A-Moebe</h1>
    <p>Hardware interfacing</p>
    <p><em>Python, HTML, SCSS, JS, Flask</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A-Moebe is an ongoing project that I've been developing with my girlfriend since June of 2023. It's a gamerunner that can be installed on a Raspberry Pi to control the gameflow of an escaperoom.</p>
    <h2>Process</h2>
    This system started with development because a friend had started his own escaperoom business. He needed a system that would automate a lot of the processes that are normally done manually. My girlfriend and I began making multiple MVP's in order to create what was necessary.
    I did all of the back-end, using Python, Flask and a lot of JavaScript. She did most of the front-end, also teaching me how to do so in the process. 
    It started very basic, using ongoing SSH connections to set certain outputs on the Raspberry Pi to high or low. This was done to control the lights and magnetic locks in the room. 
    This was a solid proof of concept but was too slow for the real-time data we needed. We then switched to using WebSockets/MQTT to send data back and forth. This was a lot faster and more reliable.
    <h2>Features</h2>
    A-Moebe features a lot of different things that can be controlled in the room.

    A resetlist that will make it impossible to make any mistakes while resetting, since the game can only be started when all steps are completed.

    A tasklist during the game so the host knows where the players are, and can solve tasks for players incase there are no sensors in place. This will execute any consequences that are tied to that task (like turning on lights, opening locks, etc).

    A list of actuators, this can be used during or outside of a game in order to forcefully turn on or off certain outputs.

    A list of statusses, this list is updated in realtime. Here the host can see whether lights are on/off, locks are locked or unlocked, whether certain sensors are triggered or what the last entered code on a keypad is, etc. Everything gets displayed here.
