        <h2>Fruity Frank</h2>
        <em>JS, HTML, CSS</em>
        <p>
            For the second project in the first year of HBO-ICT, the goal was to recreate a classic arcade game, but with a clear twist. 
            <strong>Fruity Frank</strong> is a spinoff of the classic Mario/Donkey Kong game, but with a twist. Instead of having to walk up the platforms to save the princess, you are on top of the platforms and have to throw fruits at incoming enemies to protect your fruit bowl.

        <h2>Last Stand</h2>
        <em>Unity, C#, PHP</em>
        <p>
            This was my first project in Unity. The goal of the project was to create a game in Unity that is playable in the browser. We were not allowed to use the inspector to change values, so everything had to be done in code. 
            <strong>Last Stand</strong> is a bullet hell game where you have to survive as long as possible against incoming projectiles. This game only uses primitive shapes for the enemies and the player.

        <h2>The Cube</h2>
        <em>Arduino, C++, HTML, CSS, JS</em>
        <p>
            In the last semester of my second year, I followed a minor called Internet of Things. I learned all about microcontrollers, sensors, and how to program them. 
            <strong>The Cube</strong> was a project for the individual assignment of the minor. It's a small handheld game device that closely resembles "Bop-It!".

        <h2>A-Moebe</h2>
        <em>Python, HTML, CSS, JS, Flask</em>
        <p>
            <strong>A-Moebe</strong> is a project that was not made for school, but for a friend who started his business building escape rooms. 
            This is an all-in-one system that can be used to control the escape room. It has a timer, a hint system, a way to control the lights and sounds in the room, turn magnetic locks on and off, read sensor data in real time, and do this all dynamically.

        <p>
            Due to school restrictions, I cannot share the GitLab repository of the projects made specifically for school.
