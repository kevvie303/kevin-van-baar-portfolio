        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This project was part of the Minor Internet of Things after I switched from Game Development to Technical Informatics. 
            The minor had two separate assignments, each lasting 10 weeks. This page is dedicated to the individual project, "The Cube".
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            This was my first time working with C++, which took some time to get used to. Python was not allowed, so I had to learn C++ from scratch. 
            Several blueprints were available to choose from, but given my experience with making games, I chose the handheld device blueprint.

            <strong>The Cube</strong> is a cubical handheld device with buttons on every face and a small LCD display on the front that gives players prompts to follow. 
            The goal is to follow the prompts as quickly as possible. Each time a prompt is completed, the player scores a point and gets less time for the next prompt. The game has three modes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Normal Mode:</strong> The standard mode where you follow prompts as fast as possible.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Mode:</strong> You have double time for the prompts, but the score is not added to the database.</li>
            <li><strong>Colourblind Mode:</strong> Instead of prompts like "press the blue button", it says "press the left button".</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>The Cube</strong> is made with an ESP32, which connects to the internet to store and access players' scores. The ESP32 is connected to the LCD display, the buttons, and the sensors that detect whether the player has completed the prompt correctly.
