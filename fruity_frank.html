        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This project required us to work in teams of two to create a game using P5.js. It was my first introduction to SCRUM methodology. 
            The goal was to create a spinoff of a classic arcade game, leading to the creation of <strong>Fruity Frank</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of the game is to protect your fruit bowl from incoming enemies. You are positioned on top of platforms and must throw fruits at enemies to safeguard your fruit bowl. 
            There are four types of fruits that you can throw at the enemies. You can select these fruits using the mouse and click on the abilities in the hotbar at the bottom of the screen.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
            Early on, we decided that my main focus would be on the game mechanics, weapons, art, and back-end, while my partner would focus on developing the enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning back-end development was new to me, and I had to start from scratch. I ended up using Google Firebase, managing data storage and retrieval exclusively through JavaScript.
            In the end, I gained solid experience in both JavaScript and back-end development, learning to use classes in JavaScript and organizing code into multiple files to enhance maintainability.
