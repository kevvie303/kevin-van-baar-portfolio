        <p>
            Doing HBO-ICT at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences has opened my eyes to the world of software engineering.  
            The first year really proved to me that developing and programming was in my nature and my passion, but designing the games was not my strong suit.
            Since then I've experienced with different aspects of software engineering, such as web development and embedded systems.
            As soon as I've laid my hands on my first Raspberry Pi, I knew that working with embedded systems was my calling.

            However, there's so much more to learn. I aspire to really get to know the ins and outs of embedded systems.
            This means reading deeper into how the hardware functions and how to truly optimise the software for this hardware.
            I've also been looking into the creation of custom pcb's, and aspire to learn how to create solid and reliable pcb's.   
            Additionally, It's been bugging me to not know how to properly use Docker and deployment of websites/backends, this also is something I want to learn.
